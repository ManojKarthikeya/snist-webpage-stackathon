				<h4 class="peo">Programme Educational Objectives (PEOs):</h4>

				<p>
					The PEO's have been designed so as to provide the students
					with Strong Fundamentals, Equip them with Modern tools for
					Investigation, make them Understand the concept of Team
					work, Earn the Trust and Respect of others and in the
					process make them Life-long learners.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Graduates will have a strong foundation in fundamentals
						of mathematics, natural and environmental sciences, and
						basic engineering skills with abilities of problem
						analysis, design and development of optimal solutions to
						engineering problems and make them to pursue higher
						studies in nationally / internationally reputed
						institutes or research and development activities thus
						making them life-long learners.
					</li>
					<li>
						Graduates can apply the knowledge of theory, tools of
						investigation, and use of modern tools to solve complex
						problems and ecome professionally competent and globally
						employable engineers to assess health, safety, legal,
						societal, and environmental and sustainable issues
						maintaining ethical principles.
					</li>
					<li>
						Graduates will be trained in Safety, regulatory and
						Intellectual Property related issues in broader social
						context and sustainable development, Professional
						ethics, communication skills, team work skills,
						leadership and multidisciplinary approach.
					</li>
					<li>
						Graduates will have ability to work effectively as an
						individual, a team member, a leader or an entrepreneur
						with awareness of gender sensitiveness apart from having
						good communication, project and finance management
						skills, earn the trust and respect of others as
						effective and ethical team member.
					</li>
