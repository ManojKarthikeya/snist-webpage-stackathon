							Innovation can occur in spaces of many different
							shapes and sizes, from skunkworks and internal
							start-ups to large scale laboratories and
							manufacturing facilities. It is important to
							recognize that utilizing design in any workspace or
							R&D facility should be a strategy, not a perk.
							Design is integral for defining a culture and
							optimizing productivity.Research and development is
							increasingly becoming a significant focus on the
							agenda for ambitious businesses that aspire to be at
							the top of their industry. Huawei, for example, have
							recently declared their continuous investment in
							innovation, with more than 45 percent of their total
							workforce worldwide comprising of R&D employees.
							Currently, the Chinese ICT solutions provider sits
							in third place of the market share, but boldly
							predicts that they will surpass Apple as the
							second-biggest smartphone player in the world in
							three years, and knocking Samsung off the top spot
							by 2021. This doesn’t seem unreasonable with their
							tenacious growth and commitment to design and
							innovation.
